<p>El resumen anterior está basado en la tabla que se muestra a continuación. La columna <strong>Z-Score</strong> muestra un dato estádistico que da idea de cómo se posiciona esa propiedad en precio con respecto a las demás de la misma tipología y zona en cada momento en en el tiempo:</p>
<ul>
<li>El valor 0 indica que está justo en la media.</li>
<li>Un valor negativo la posiciona por debajo de la media (tiende a ser barata), y cuanto más se aleja de 0 más barata resulta.</li>
<li>Un valor positivo la posiciona por encima de la media (tiende a ser cara), y cuanto más se aleja de 0 más cara resulta.</li>
